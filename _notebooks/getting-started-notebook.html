<p>This is an example JS notebook for Cytoscape automation. This format supports common HTML and JS components, 
    in addition to markdown and liquid syntax. For the majority of cases, we recommend a notebook style layout 
    of alternating text (like this) and dynamic elements provided by js4cytoscape.
</p>

<h3>The Cytoscape Badge</h3>
<p>For example, the Cytoscape badge is provided by a js4cytoscape:</p> 

<span class="cytoscape-badge"></span>
<br /><br />

<p>This badge reports the status of your local instance of Cytoscape, displaying the version if it is successfully 
    detected. We recommend adding this badge at the top of each of your notebooks. Just insert this single line of code!
</p>

{% highlight html %}
<span class="cytoscape-badge"></span>
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Single Function Buttons</h3>
<p>Now, let's open a sample network and demo a few of the operations you can control Cytoscape from a JS notebook.</p>

<button onclick="openSession()">Open sample session</button>
<br /><br />

<p>Did you see the session load in your local Cytoscape? This is a simple example of a single js4cytoscape function
    associated with a button, like so:
</p>

{% highlight html %}
<button onclick="openSession()">Open sample session</button>
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Multiple Functions</h3>
<p>You can also trigger an entire workflow with a single button click.</p>

<button id="my-workflow">My workflow</button>
<br /><br />

<p>This can be accomplished by setting a button id and then defining a function triggered by its click:</p>

{% highlight html %}
<button id="my-workflow">My workflow</button>

<script>
    $('#my-workflow').click(function(){
        closeSession(false);
        openSession();
        //whatever you want here
    })
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Embed Snapshots</h3>
<p>You can also take snapshots of your work and then embed them in the notebook.</p>

<button id="show-my-work">Show my work</button>
<div id="work-shown"></div>
<br />

<p>And here is what that code looks like:</p>

{% highlight html %}
<button id="show-my-work">Show my work</button>
<div id="work-shown"></div>

<script>
    $('#show-my-work').click(function(){
        //export image
        //insert image at div $('#work-shown')
    })
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

<script>
$('#my-workflow').click(function(){
    closeSession(false);
    openSession();
})
$('#show-my-work').click(function(){
    //export image
    //insert image at div $('#work-shown')
})
</script>
