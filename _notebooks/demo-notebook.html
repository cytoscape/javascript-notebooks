<p>This is an example JS notebook for Cytoscape automation. This format supports common HTML and JS components, 
    in addition to markdown and liquid syntax. For the majority of cases, we recommend a notebook style layout 
    of alternating text (like this) and dynamic elements provided by js4cytoscape (like the one below).</p>

<button class="cytobutton" id="cytobutton" title="Cytoscape is connected">Cytoscape is connected</button>

<br /><br />
<p>This element is a basic check to see if Cytoscape is installed and running. It only takes a single line of 
    code to add this to your notebook:
</p>

{% highlight html %}
<button class="cytobutton" id="cytobutton" title="Cytoscape is connected">Cytoscape is connected</button>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now, let's open a sample network and demo a few of the operations you can control Cytoscape from a JS notebook.</p>
