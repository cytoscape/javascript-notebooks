<p>This is an example JS notebook for Cytoscape automation. This format supports common HTML and JS components, 
    in addition to markdown and liquid syntax. For the majority of cases, we recommend a notebook style layout 
    of alternating text (like this) and dynamic elements provided by js4cytoscape.</p>
<p>For example, the Cytoscape badge is provided by a js4cytoscape:</p> 

<span class="cytoscape-badge"></span>

<br /><br />
<p>This badge reports the status of Cytoscape, displaying the version if it is successfully detected. We recommend 
    adding this badge at the top of each of your notebooks. Just insert this single line of code!
</p>

{% highlight html %}
<span class="cytoscape-badge"></span>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now, let's open a sample network and demo a few of the operations you can control Cytoscape from a JS notebook.</p>
